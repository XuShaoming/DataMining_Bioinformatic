In this project, I implement the PCA algorithm from scratch, then compare its performance with SVD and T-SNE algorithms by using the Matplotlib scatter graph. There two versions of source code. To run it, you need:
    
To run the .py version

    To intall python3 : 
        https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/

    To install Numpy and Matplotlib :
    	https://www.scipy.org/install.html


To run the .ipynb version:

	To intall python3, Numpy and Matplotlib as mentioned above. 

	To install jupyter notebook :
