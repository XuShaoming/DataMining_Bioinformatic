# DataMining_Bioinformatic
### Fall 2018, University at Buffalo.
## Description
    This repository includes three projects from course cs601 DataMining&Bioinformatic.
## Prerequisites
There two versions of source code. To run it, you need:  
#### To run the .py version  
    To intall python3 :  
        https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/  
    To install Numpy and Matplotlib :  
    	https://www.scipy.org/install.html     
#### To run the .ipynb version:  
	To intall python3, Numpy and Matplotlib as mentioned above.   
	To install jupyter notebook :  
        http://jupyter.org/install  
        
## Project 1:
  #### First part: PCA algorithm  
    I implement the PCA algorithm from scratch, then compare its performance with SVD and T-SNE algorithms by using the Matplotlib scatter graph.
  #### Second part: Appriori and Association rule algorithm
    I implement the appriori and association rule algorithm from scratch, then write three templetes to mining rules.
