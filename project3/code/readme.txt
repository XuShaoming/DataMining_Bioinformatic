1. To use naive_bayes.py and Knn.py,  you do not need to preprocess the label.

2. To use the decision_tree.py, random_forest.py and adaboost.py, you need to 
guarantee the label to be negative: -1 and postive: +1. you can use the function convert_label() to do it. You can find how to use it in my test unit. convert_label() defined in mylibrary.py
